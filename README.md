### Description

The original idea, graphics and sound came from an email I got with some JavaScript code to perform the same, but it was incredibly slow, so someone asked me to create a stand-alone program out of it, and this was the result.<br><br>

It demonstrates the BitBlt and LineTo API, and GetTickCount used in a loop. And furthermore, it's fun! :)<br><br>

Just hope this helps in some way, please leave comments and don't forget to vote!
